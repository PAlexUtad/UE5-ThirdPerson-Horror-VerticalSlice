## 📖 About The Project

> *Treading Down The Garden Path* is a short, self-contained horror game demo developed entirely in Blueprint using Unreal Engine 5.  
> Inspired by my graphic novel of the same name, this vertical slice blends atmospheric exploration, light combat, and fixed-camera puzzle design in a surreal mirror of a decaying city.
